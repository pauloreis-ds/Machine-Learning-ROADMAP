# Regression Problems

- Regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the 'outcome variable', y) and one or more independent variables (often called 'predictors', 'covariates', or 'features', X)<br> 

- A regression problem is when the output variable is a real or continuous value, such as “salary” or “weight”.


> Given the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, house location and/or more, predict the sale price of a given house.

> How much will bitcoin be worth tomorrow?

    - Which of the following is a regression task?
      - Predicting age of a person?
      - Predicting nationality of a person?
      - Predicting whether stock price of a company will increase tomorrow?
      - Predicting whether a document is related to sighting of UFOs?
    
    Answer: predicting age of a person, because it is a real value.
    Predicting nationality is categorical, whether stock price will increase is discrete (yes/no answer), 
    predicting whether a document is related to UFO is again discrete (yes/no answer).

A continuous output variable is a real-value, such as an integer or floating point value. These are often quantities, such as amounts and sizes.

For example, a house may be predicted to sell for a specific dollar value, perhaps in the range of $100,000 to $200,000.

- A regression problem requires the prediction of a quantity.
- A regression can have real valued or discrete input variables.
- A problem with multiple input variables is often called a multivariate regression problem.
- A regression problem where input variables are ordered by time is called a time series forecasting problem.


## Convert Between Classification and Regression Problems

- In some cases, it is possible to convert a regression problem to a classification problem. For example, the quantity to be predicted could be converted into discrete buckets. For example, amounts in a continuous range between $0 and $100 could be converted into 2 buckets:

Class 0: $0 to $49
Class 1: $50 to $100

We could also convert each age of a person into a "class"... which normally it wouldn't make sense? but we could do that or as in the example above "0 to 12", 13 to 21"... It depends on the case. Anyway...

This is often called discretization and the resulting output variable is a classification where the labels have an ordered relationship (called ordinal).
