ML: What to start with?

**_Understand The Basis._**

- [Types of learning](https://github.com/pauloreis-ds/Machine-Learning-ROADMAP/tree/master/0%20-%20Types%20of%20learning)
  - Supervised learning
  - Unsupervised learning
  - Reinforcement learning
  - Transfer learning
 
**_What can you do? Why would you do it?_** 
 
- ML Problems:
  - [Classification](https://github.com/pauloreis-ds/Machine-Learning-ROADMAP/tree/master/1%20-%20Classification)
  - [Regression](https://github.com/pauloreis-ds/Machine-Learning-ROADMAP/tree/master/2%20-%20Regression)
  - [Clustering](https://github.com/pauloreis-ds/Machine-Learning-ROADMAP/tree/master/3%20-%20Clustering)
  - Sequence to Sequence 
      - Seq2seq is a family of machine learning approaches used for language processing.
        Applications include language translation, image captioning, conversational models and text summarization.
  - Dimensionality Reduction
      - Techniques to reduce the number of inputs into a model by mapping the features into lower dimensional space
 
**_How to do it?_** 
 
- ML Process:
  - [Data Collection](https://github.com/pauloreis-ds/Machine-Learning-ROADMAP/tree/master/4%20-%20Data%20Collection)
  - [Data Preparation](https://github.com/pauloreis-ds/Machine-Learning-ROADMAP/tree/master/5%20-%20Data%20Preparation)
      - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
      - Data Preprocessing
      - Data Splitting
  - [Training Model]()
  
  - [Analysis/Evaluation]()
  
  - [Deploying Model]()
  
  - [Retrain Model]()
  



Types of problems:
1. Helping users find the right thing when they search? This is a ranking problem. Google, Bing, and Twitter search are all doing this — trying to sort things when you query so that the thing you’re looking for is at the top.

2. Giving users things they may be interested in, without them explicitly searching? This is a recommendation problem. Netflix, Spotify, who-to-follow on Twitter are examples — these products are suggesting things to engage users.

3. Figuring out what kind of thing something is? This is a classification problem. Gmail spam/not spam and Facebook photos (detecting faces) are examples here.

4. Predicting a numerical value of a thing? This is a regression problem. Predicting how much a flight will cost in two hours is an example.

5. Putting similar things together? This is clustering in action. Amazon’s customers-als0-bought is the most notable example, and we saw Spotify’s playlist addition recommendations above as well.

6. Finding uncommon things? This is usually anomaly detection. Most “trending” products (Foursquare, Twitter, Facebook) are examples, that surface things that are being tweeted/visited/talked about more than usual.

In general, 1–4 are examples of supervised learning, and 5 & 6 fall into the unsupervised learning domain. However, there are obvious cross-overs here: for example, a recommendation problem is a kind of classification problem — the algorithm is trying to predict whether a user would (or would not) be interested in a thing.

Most of the data science projects fall into two main categories — a regression problem(when the target variable is continuous/numerical) or classification problem(when the target variable(s) are discrete/categorical).
