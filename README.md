ML: What to start with?

My favorite link of all (until now): [How Do We Actually machine.learning(learn=True) Things?](https://github.com/pauloreis-ds/Paulo-Reis-Data-Science/blob/master/3%20-%20Data%20Analysis%20(Machine%20Learning)/How%20to%20code%20and%20create%20any%20machine%20learning%20model.ipynb)

**_Understand The Basis. \[Press Start\]_**

- [Types of learning](https://github.com/pauloreis-ds/Machine-Learning-ROADMAP/tree/master/0%20-%20Types%20of%20learning)
  - Supervised learning
  - Unsupervised learning
  - Reinforcement learning
  - Transfer learning
 
**_What can you do? Why would you do it?_** 
 
- ML Problems:
  - [Classification](https://github.com/pauloreis-ds/Machine-Learning-ROADMAP/tree/master/1%20-%20Classification)
  - [Regression](https://github.com/pauloreis-ds/Machine-Learning-ROADMAP/tree/master/2%20-%20Regression)
  - [Clustering](https://github.com/pauloreis-ds/Machine-Learning-ROADMAP/tree/master/3%20-%20Clustering)
  - Sequence to Sequence 
      - Seq2seq is a family of machine learning approaches used for language processing.
        Applications include language translation, image captioning, conversational models and text summarization.
  - Dimensionality Reduction
      - Techniques to reduce the number of inputs into a model by mapping the features into lower dimensional space

> Most of the data science projects fall into two main categories â€” a regression problem (when the target variable is continuous/numerical) or classification one (when the target variable is discrete/categorical).

**_How to do it?_** 
 
- ML Process:
  - [Data Collection](https://github.com/pauloreis-ds/Machine-Learning-ROADMAP/tree/master/4%20-%20Data%20Collection)
  - [Data Preparation](https://github.com/pauloreis-ds/Machine-Learning-ROADMAP/tree/master/5%20-%20Data%20Preparation)
      - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
      - Data Preprocessing
      - Data Splitting
  - [Training Model](https://github.com/pauloreis-ds/Machine-Learning-ROADMAP/tree/master/6%20-%20Training%20Model)
      - Choose an Algorithm.
      - Overfit the Model.
      - Reduce overfitting with regularization.
  - [Analysis/Evaluation](https://github.com/pauloreis-ds/Machine-Learning-ROADMAP/tree/master/7%20-%20Analysis~Evaluation)
  
  - [Deploying Model](https://huyenchip.com/2020/06/22/mlops.html)
