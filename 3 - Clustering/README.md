# Clustering Problems
- Cluster analysis is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters).

    Group the customers of the business by their purchases. Labels for the gourps aren't given
    (making it an unsupervised problem). Once groups are found, labels can be added.
