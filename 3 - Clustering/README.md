# Clustering Problems
- Cluster analysis is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters).

        Cluster Analysis has been used in marketing for various purposes. Group the customers of the business by their purchases.
        Labels for the groups aren't given (making it an **unsupervised** problem). Once groups are found, labels can be added.
    
Cluster analysis involves formulating a problem, selecting a distance measure, selecting a clustering procedure, deciding the number of clusters, interpreting the profile clusters and finally, assessing the validity of clustering.

- Typical applications
    - As a stand-alone tool to get insight into data distribution.
    - As a preprocessing step for other algorithms.

- Examples of Clustering Applications
    - Marketing: Help marketers discover distinct groups in their customer bases, and then use this knowledge to develop targeted marketing programs.
    - Land use: Identification of areas of similar land use in an earth observation database.
    - Insurance: Identifying groups of motor insurance policy holders with a high average claim cost.
    - City-planning: Identifying groups of houses according to their house type, value, and geographical location.
    - Earth-quake studies: Observed earth quake epicenters should be clustered along continent faults.
