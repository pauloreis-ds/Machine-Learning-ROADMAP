# Data Splitting
#### "_Divide and Conquer_"

Training set (usually 70-80% of data): Model learns on this.

Validation set (typically 10-15% of data): Model hyperparameters are tuned on this.

Test set (usually 10-15%): Models final performance is evaluated on this. If you've done it right, hopefully the results on the test set give a good indication of hpw the model should perform in the real world. Do not use this dataset to tune the model.
