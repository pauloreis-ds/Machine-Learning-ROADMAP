# Data Preprocessing
#### "_We torture data until it confesses_"

- Preparing your data to be modelled.

      + Basically, there are 6 steps:
      
      - Feature imputation: filling missing values (a machine learning model can't learn on data that isn't there).
      
      - Feature encoding (turning values into numbers). A machine learning model requires all values to be numerical.
      
      - Feature normalization (scaling) or standardization. When your numerical variables are on different scales 
        (number_of_bathrooms is between 1 and 5 and size_of_land_ between 5,000 and 20,000 sq feet), some machine learning
        algorithms don't perform very well. Scaling and standardization help to fix this.
      
      - Feature engineering: transform data into (potentially) more meaningful representations by adding in domain knowledge.
      
      - Feature selection: selecting the most valuable features of your dataset to model. Potentially reducing overfitting 
        and training time (less overall data and less redundant data to train on) and improving accuracy.
      
      - Dealing with imbalances: does your data have 10,000 examples of one class but only 100 examples of another?
