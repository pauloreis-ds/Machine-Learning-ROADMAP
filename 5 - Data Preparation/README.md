# Data Preparation
#### _"Success is when persistence meets preparation"_

Business decisions rely on analytics. But, if the data is inaccurate or incomplete, your analytics will be bad and that could cost a lot of money to the company. Because bad analytics means poor business decisions. 

Besides that, good data preparation allows for efficient analysis, limits errors and inaccuracies that can occur to data during processing, and makes all processed data more accessible to other users.

    It is essential to put data in context in order to turn it into insights and eliminate bias resulting from poor data quality.

Data preparation is the process of cleaning and transforming raw data prior to processing and analysis. It often involves reformatting data, making corrections to data, handling missing data and combining data sets to enrich the whole. It also usually includes standardizing data formats, enriching source data, and/or removing outliers.
