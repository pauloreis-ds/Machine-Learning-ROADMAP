# Exploratory Data Analysis
#### "_Not all those who wander are lost_"
- The quality of your inputs decide the quality of your output.

     
       Here's where we try to better understand the dataset. ‘Understanding the dataset’ can refer to a number of things
       including but not limited to...
       
        - Extracting important variables and leaving behind useless ones.
        - Identifying outliers, missing values, or human error.
        - Understanding the relationships, or lack of them, between variables.
        - Ultimately, maximizing your insights of a dataset and minimizing potential error that may occur later in the process.

### Some questions to have in mind.

- What are the feature variables (input - X) and the target variables (output - y)? For example, for predicting heart disease, the feature variables may be a person's age, weight, average heart rate and more... and the target variable will be whether or not they have heart disease.

- What kind of data do we have (structured, unstructured, categorical, numerial)? Create a data dictionary for what each feature is. If you've got a column of numbers called "hr" how would someone else know that it actually means Heart Rate?

- Are there missing values? Should you remove them or fill them with feature imputation?

- Where are the outliers? How many of them are there? Are they out by much (3+standard deviations)? Why are they there?

- Are there questions you could ask a domain expert about the data? For example, would a heart disease physician be able to shed some light on your heart disease dataset?

> ps: visualization can help you in this task, so make good use of graphs... and also, after you learn how to manipulate data to do all this, you'll need to know some statistics in order to comprehend what the data is telling you.

[guide-data-exploration](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/01/guide-data-exploration/) - "There are no shortcuts for data exploration. If you are in a state of mind, that machine learning can sail you away from every data storm, trust me, it won’t. After some point of time, you’ll realize that you are struggling at improving model’s accuracy. In such situation, data exploration techniques will come to your rescue".
