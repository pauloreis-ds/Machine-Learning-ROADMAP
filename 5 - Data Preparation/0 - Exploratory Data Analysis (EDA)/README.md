# Exploratory Data Analysis
#### "_Not all those who wander are lost_"

What are the feature variables (input - X) and the target variables (output - y)? For example, for predicting heart disease, the feature variables may be a person's age, weight, average heart rate and more... and the target variable will be whether or not ther have heart disease.

What kind of data do we have (structured, unstructured, categorical, numerial)? Create a data dictionary for what each feature is. If you've got a column of numbers called "hr" how would someone else know that it actually means Heart Rate?

Are there missing values? Should you remove them or fill them with feature imputation?

Where are the outliers? How many of them are there? Are they out by much (3+standard deviations)? Why are they there?

Are there questions you could ask a domain expert about the data? For example, would a heart disease physicion be able to shed some light on your hear diseas dataset?
