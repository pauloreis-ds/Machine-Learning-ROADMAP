# Data Collection.
#### "Without data, you're just another person with an opinion"

## Questions to ask
* What kind of problem are we trying to solve?
* What data sources already exist?
* What privacy concerns are there?
* Is the data public?
* Where should we store the data?

## Types of data
- **Unstructed data:** data with no rigid structure (images, videos, natural language text/speech).
- **Structed data:** data which appears in tabulated format (rows and columns, a spreadsheet)

+[Types of data](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-types-in-statistics-347e152e8bee):<br>
 -Categorical<br>
 -Numerical<br>
 -Ordinal<br>
 -Time Series (Data Across time)<br>

The company may have its own data, so you would get it using **SQL** or another tool. If not, it is possible that you would have to do some web scraping using **BeautifulSoup**, **Selenium** or **Scrapy**. [Here's a quick overview about them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zucvHSQsKHA).
