# Overfitting
#### _"Stay foolish stay hungry"_

- Overfitting happens when your validation loss (how your model is performing on the validation dataset, lower is better) starts to increase.
Or if you don't have a validation set, it happens when the model performs far better on the training set than on the test set (99% accuracy on training set, 67% on the test set).

> Underfitting happens when your model doesn't perform as well as you'd like on your data. Try training for longer or a more advanced/suitable model.


## Regularization: a collection of techniques to prevent/reduce overfitting.
