# Choosing an Algorithm
#### _"When you want the absolute best chance to succeed at anything you want, your approach should always be the same. Go small"_

      Supervised Algorithms
        Linear Regression
        Logistic Regression
        K-Nearest Neighbours
        Support Vector Machine (SVM)
        Decision Tree
        Random Forest
        Gradient Boosting Machine
        Neural Network (deep learning)

     Unsupervised Algorithms
        K-Means Clustering
        Anomaly Detection (one class --> K-Means, SVM)
        Visualization and Dimensionality Reduction
