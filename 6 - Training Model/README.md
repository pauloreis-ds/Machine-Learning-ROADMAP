# Training Model
#### _"When you want the absolute best chance to succeed at anything you want, your approach should always be the same. Go small"_

[Machine Learning](https://github.com/pauloreis-ds/Paulo-Reis-Data-Science/tree/master/3%20-%20Data%20Analysis%20(Machine%20Learning)) - simplified.

- [Choose an Algorithm](https://github.com/pauloreis-ds/Machine-Learning-ROADMAP/blob/master/6%20-%20Training%20Model/Choosing%20an%20algorithm.md).
- [Overfit the Model](https://github.com/pauloreis-ds/Machine-Learning-ROADMAP/blob/master/6%20-%20Training%20Model/Overfit%20the%20Model.md).
    - Reduce overfitting with regularization.
    - Hyperparameter Tuning.

        
        To sum up: 
            1 - Choose an Algorithm  \(* - *)/
            2 - Test it (How good it is?)  ('-' )
            3 - Make it better (Hyperparameter Tuning)  .-.
            4 - If needed, Do the same with another model(s) that suits the problem \o\|o|/o/
